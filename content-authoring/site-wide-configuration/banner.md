1. Banner type - Select inherit (to use the site-wide banner type set in Blocks), Default (to keep default visual type) or large for a bigger banner.&#x20;
2. Banner theme - Select inherit (to inherit default theme), light or dark.
3. Banner title - You can leave this blank (then the page title will be used) or add something in here to override the page title.
4. Hide breadcrumb - You can select this box to hide the breadcrumb (good for the homepage).
5. Background - This accordion can be opened up and you can upload a background image that is applied to the whole banner.
6. Featured image - This accordion can be opened up and you can add a featured image, which will be displayed on the right-hand side of the banner.
7. Banner components - In this section you can add components into the banner (e.g. additional content). The components available are Add content, Add manual list, Add iFrame, Add map and Add slider. However, the 'Add content' component is probably the most common use-case.&#x20;
8. Banner bottom components - In this section you can add components that will sit just below the banner (but above the main content area). The components available are Add content, Add accordion, Add automated list, Add callout, Add campaign, Add iFrame, Add manual list, Add map, Add promo, Add slider and Add webform. Add manual list is probably the most common use-case. For example, in the screenshot at the top of this page, the banner bottom component is a manual list with four navigation cards. &#x20;
