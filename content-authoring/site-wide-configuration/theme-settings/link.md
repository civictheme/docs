# Link

### Link options

#### Open links in a new window

Will open all internal and external links in a new window.

#### Open external links in a new window

Will only open external links in a new window. Internal links will open in the same window. This is the most common behaviour.

#### Override external link domains

There might be a reason to treat an external link like an internal link and open it in the same window. If so, follow the instructions and add one domain to exclude per line.

### How to change the Link settings&#x20;

1. Go to `/admin/appearance/settings/<site-name>`
2. Scroll down to the 'Component' section.
3. Select 'link'.
