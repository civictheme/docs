### Storybook <a href="#civicthemeconfiguration-storybookfor-your_theme-theme" id="civicthemeconfiguration-storybookfor-your_theme-theme"></a>

Storybook demonstrates components used in your site as a standalone library.

The components in the Storybook are a visual representation and they are not connected to the Drupal components.

Each component has properties that allow you to change the component and see how it visually changes.

While being primarily a development tool, the Storybook allows everyone to see all components at-a-glance without creating any special content for it.
