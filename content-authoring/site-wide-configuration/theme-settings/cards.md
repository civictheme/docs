# Cards

There are four cards available:

* Event card
* Navigation card
* Publication card
* Promo card

Each of these cards has an option to display a summary (Fig. 1).&#x20;

If you choose to add a summary to your cards, follow these steps to individually configure the character count for each card type. This will set the character count for each card type site-wide.
