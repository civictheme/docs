# Social links

You can create a social links block and apply it site-wide, or apply it on a per-page basis.

CivicTheme comes with a set of social media icons for Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter. You can upload other social media icons for different platforms. These must be in SVG format to ensure your brand colours will be applied.

**Note on theme settings**: If you set your social media link block to display in the footer aligned with the [footer logo](footer-logo.md), you need to ensure you set the theme, `Light`or `Dark`,the same for the logos and the social links.&#x20;

1. Go to the Content > Blocks, or `/admin/structure/block/block-content`
2. Click `Add custom block`
3. Select 'Social links block'
4. Select the 'Light' or 'Dark' theme
5. Choose an exisiting icon (for Facebook, LinkedIn or Twitter), or, upload a new icons for other social media platforms (note: these must be .svg files)
