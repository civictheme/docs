# Logo

Logo is used in Header and Footer. See sub-sections about how to choose the type of Logo for [Header](../../configuration/header.md) and [Footer](../../configuration/footer.md).

This section explains how to upload different logos to be available in Header and Footer.

Logo may consist of Primary and Secondary images. This is useful in cases where a logo consist of 2 images: your logo and Commonwealth Coat of Arms, for example.

Then, Primary and Secondary images can exist in Desktop and Mobile sizes to make the logos fit the design better.

Finally, each logo size exists in `Light` and `Dark` theme. This is to make logos contrast enough to be seen in the Header or Footer of the same theme.
