# Overview

### Content types <a href="#contentauthoring-overview-contenttypes" id="contentauthoring-overview-contenttypes"></a>

Out-of-the-box, CivicTheme comes with 3 content types:

* Alert
* Event
* Page.&#x20;

These are the most common content types that you would need to start of as a base. You can add more content types as you wish.

### Alert <a href="#contentauthoring-overview-alert" id="contentauthoring-overview-alert"></a>

Use alerts to provide information for site users using a status bar. Common examples are announcements, notices, warning, downtime alerts or any other alerts that you want your site visitor to see right away at the top of the page.

Alerts consist of the following fields:

* Title
* Message
* Type (Information, Success, Warning, Error)
* Date range
* Visibility.

The final output is shown in Figure 1 and shows where it is placed on the page. By default it appears above the header region.



Depending on which “type” you select, the Alert background colour can be different. Figure 2 shows the different Alert types and their associated colours.



## Event <a href="#contentauthoring-overview-event" id="contentauthoring-overview-event"></a>

As the name suggests, you can use the Event content type for events.

When you add an Event, there are 2 tabs: Content and Event.

The fields for the Content tab are shown in Figure 3.



The fields for the Event tab are shown in Figure 4.



The final output is shown in Figure 5.



### Page <a href="#contentauthoring-overview-page" id="contentauthoring-overview-page"></a>

Use Page for your static content such as an 'About us' page or other informational pages that will always be accessible on the site. These can be simple content pages or pages with a complex layout.

When you add a Page, there are 2 tabs: Content and Banner.

The fields for the Content tab are shown in Figure 6.



The fields for the Banner tab are shown in Figure 7.



The final output of a simple Page is shown in Figure 8. You can add [various components](broken-reference) to the Page in the Banner tab.
