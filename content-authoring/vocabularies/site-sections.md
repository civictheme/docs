# Site sections

### Summary

Site-section taxonomy is generally used to sort/group content by site section. &#x20;

The idea is to allow groupping of pages that belonging to a common area. For example, your website might include multiple sub-sites with different styles and/or branding within the sub-site.&#x20;

At the moment, CivicTheme injects that CSS class to the `<body>` of the page to allow applying different styles. In the future, you'll also be able to add custom logos and menus.

### How to add a site section

You can add a new site section by clicking on List terms or Add terms from the dropdown menu to the right of 'Site sections'.&#x20;

If you select List terms, you'll then need to click Add term.

Add in the name, relationships (parent terms) and menu item weight and then click Save.&#x20;
