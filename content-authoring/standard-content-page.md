# Standard Content Page

### Summary   <a href="#creatingastandardcontentpage-summary" id="creatingastandardcontentpage-summary"></a>

This article will guide you through creating a Standard Content Page.

A Standard Content Page can be a simple page with a title and body or it can be complex if you were to [add components](broken-reference).

### Step 1 - Go to the admin content area <a href="#creatingastandardcontentpage-step1-gototheadmincontentarea" id="creatingastandardcontentpage-step1-gototheadmincontentarea"></a>

There are two ways to access the admin content area in Drupal.

Option 1 - Go directly to _\[your domain]/admin/content_

Option 2 - At the top left of the admin navigation bar, click on “Manage” to expand the second menu bar, then click on “Content”. This is shown in Figure 1 below.



### Step 2 - Click on “Add content” <a href="#creatingastandardcontentpage-step2-clickon-addcontent" id="creatingastandardcontentpage-step2-clickon-addcontent"></a>

Once you are in the admin content area, at the top left, click on the “Add content” button as shown in Figure 2.



### Step 3 - Add a Page <a href="#creatingastandardcontentpage-step3-addapage" id="creatingastandardcontentpage-step3-addapage"></a>

CivicTheme comes with 3 content types by default. These are Alert, Event and Page.

Click on Page as shown in Figure 3.



### Step 4 - Insert your content <a href="#creatingastandardcontentpage-step4-insertyourcontent" id="creatingastandardcontentpage-step4-insertyourcontent"></a>

You will notice there are two (2) tabs by default. These are “Content” and “Banner”.

Under the “Content” tab, fill in the minimum required field which is the Title field.

You can fill in the rest of the fields as you wish including the fields under the “Banner” tab, although it is fine to leave the defaults.

CivicTheme has “Components” that you can add to the Page. Each “Component” is a different content format.

For a simple text area, you can click on “Add Content” from the Components dropdown (see Figure 4).



The “Add Content” component will give you a text area as shown in Figure 5. Enter your custom text into the text area.



Click on “Save” when you are finished.
