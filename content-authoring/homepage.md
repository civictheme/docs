### Summary <a href="#editingthehomepage-summary" id="editingthehomepage-summary"></a>

This article will show you how to edit the homepage of your CivicTheme website.

### Step 1 - Edit the homepage <a href="#editingthehomepage-step1-editthehomepage" id="editingthehomepage-step1-editthehomepage"></a>

Once logged in, go to the homepage and click on the “Edit” button just below the banner as shown below.

In the editorial interface you will notice there are 2 tabs: “Content” and “Banner”.

### Step 2 - The “Content” tab <a href="#editingthehomepage-step2-the-content-tab" id="editingthehomepage-step2-the-content-tab"></a>

Under the “Content” tab, you can edit various fields. Below you can see the highlighting and numbering that we'll use to explain further down below.

1. Title - This is the title text that appears at the top of the page.
2. Summary text - This text will appear in teasers: cards and lists.
3. Show Table of Contents - If this box is checked, then any H2 HTML tags will be linked to in a tabular format. This is great for readability as it allows your site visitors to easily jump to sections further down the page.

We have added 3 example components. These are #4, #5, and #6 from the screenshot under the Content tab heading above. Below you can see the final output of these components.

7\. Click on this dropdown to add more components (see Figure 2).

Please see the [documentation page](content-types/landing-page.md) explaining each of these components in more detail.&#x20;

### Step 3 - The “Banner” tab <a href="#editingthehomepage-step3-the-banner-tab" id="editingthehomepage-step3-the-banner-tab"></a>

The “Banner” tab allows you to edit any information in the banner section (this is the section above the “Edit” button).

Please note that these are **per-page** overrides of a [site-wide banner](broken-reference) and they do not need to be updated on every page if the site-wide banner configuration is sufficient.

The available fields are shown below. We have numbered the fields and explained each.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Figure 4</p></figcaption></figure>

1. Banner type - You can specify the size of the banner here with choices of Inherit, Default or Large.&#x20;
2. Banner theme - You can specify the theme colour. “Inherit” will inherit the value defined for your custom banner block, which you can find at _\[your\_domain]/admin/structure/block/block-content._
3. Banner title - You can override the page title here.
4. Hide breadcrumb - If your homepage has a breadcrumb, checking this box will hide it. Typically, homepages do not have breadcrumbs so toggling this checkbox may not have any effect on your homepage.
5. Background image - As the name suggests, this will update the background image in the banner area.
6.  Featured image - You can apply a featured image which will appear on the right side of your banner block (see below).\
