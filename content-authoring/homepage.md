# Homepage

### Summary <a href="#editingthehomepage-summary" id="editingthehomepage-summary"></a>

This article will guide you through editing the homepage of your CivicTheme website.

By default, CivicTheme comes with a pre-built homepage (amongst other default page layouts).

### Step 1 - Edit the homepage <a href="#editingthehomepage-step1-editthehomepage" id="editingthehomepage-step1-editthehomepage"></a>

Once logged in, go to the homepage and click on the “edit” button just below the banner as shown in Figure 1.

In the editorial interface you will notice there are 2 tabs: “Content” and “Banner”.

### Step 2 - The “Content” tab <a href="#editingthehomepage-step2-the-content-tab" id="editingthehomepage-step2-the-content-tab"></a>

Under the “Content” tab, you can edit various fields. Refer to Figure 2 to see the highlighting of fields and the numbering which we will use to explain further down below.

1. Title - This is the title text that appears at the top of the page.
2. Summary text - This text will appear depending on if your theme is set to use a view mode that displays the Summary field. Not all view modes display the summary field. That is, this text may or may not appear depending on your theme configuration.
3. Table of Contents - If this box is checked, then any h2 HTML tags will be linked to in a tabular format. This is great for readability as it allows your site visitors to easily jump to sections further down the page.

We have added 3 examples components. These are #4, #5, and #6 as seen in Figures 2. Figure 4 shows the final output of these components.

7\. Click on this dropdown to add more components (see Figure 2).

Please see the documentation page explaining each of these components in more detail. \[WIP]

### Step 3 - The “Banner” tab <a href="#editingthehomepage-step3-the-banner-tab" id="editingthehomepage-step3-the-banner-tab"></a>

The “Banner” tab allows you to edit any information in the banner section (this is the section above the “edit” button as shown in Figure 3).

The available fields are shown in Figure 4. We have numbered the fields and explained each below.

1. Banner type - You can specify the size of the banner here with choices of Inherit, Default or Large. Currently, there is [bug which prevents the “Inherit” option from having any effect.](https://github.com/salsadigitalauorg/civictheme\_source/issues/897)
2. Banner theme - You can specify the theme colour. “Inherit” will inherit the value defined for your custom banner block which you can find at _\[your\_domain]/admin/structure/block/block-content._
3. Banner title - you can override the page title here.
4. Hide breadcrumb - if your homepage has a breadcrumb, checking this box will hide it. Typically, homepages do not have breadcrumbs so toggling this checkbox may not have any effect on your homepage.
5. Background image - as the name suggests, this will update the background image in the banner area.
6.  Featured image - you can apply a featured image which will appear on the right side of your banner block as shown in Figure 5.\
