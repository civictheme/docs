# Event reference card

### Summary <a href="#eventreferencecardcomponent-summary" id="eventreferencecardcomponent-summary"></a>

This article will guide you how to add an Event reference card sub-component to your Manual list component.

This component is ideal if you wanted to create a listing of previously created Events.

The Event reference card consists of an autocomplete text field.

Figure 1 shows an example of an Event reference card.



### Step 1 - Add the Event reference card <a href="#eventreferencecardcomponent-step1-addtheeventreferencecard" id="eventreferencecardcomponent-step1-addtheeventreferencecard"></a>

Inside of your Manual list component under List items, click on the dropdown and select Event reference card as shown in Figure 2.



### Step 2 - Fill in the various fields <a href="#eventreferencecardcomponent-step2-fillinthevariousfields" id="eventreferencecardcomponent-step2-fillinthevariousfields"></a>

There are only 2 fields as shown in Figure 3.



Reference - this is an autocomplete text field that will suggest **Event content type** titles as you type. Event content must exist in your site. You can create Events here: _\[your\_site]/node/add/civictheme\_event_

Theme - Select whether you want light or dark theme settings.

Figure 4 shows what happens as you type the first character into the Reference text field. The site will automatically search page titles of Event content type containing the typed character.
