### Summary <a href="#contentcomponent-summary" id="contentcomponent-summary"></a>

This article will guide you through adding a Content component.

This component is great for the scenario where you have mostly a block of text.

### Step 1 - Add the Content Component <a href="#contentcomponent-step1-addthecontentcomponent" id="contentcomponent-step1-addthecontentcomponent"></a>

Under the “Content” tab, click on “Add Content” as shown in Figure 1.



### Step 2 - Fill in the various fields <a href="#contentcomponent-step2-fillinthevariousfields" id="contentcomponent-step2-fillinthevariousfields"></a>

Figure 2 shows a numbered highlighting of the available fields.



1. WYSIWYG editor - Enter your custom text here.
2. Theme color - Select your theme color preference
3.  Vertical Spacing - There are 3 options: Top, Bottom, Both. Your choice here will add padding to the respective area. For example, if you selected “Both”, the padding is added to the top _and_ bottom of the custom text as shown in Figure 3.\



4.  Background - This will apply a themed background color depending on your choice of the theme color in point #2 above. You can find your theme colors in the Palette Colors section of your theme configuration at: _\[your\_domain]/admin/appearance/settings/\[your\_subtheme\_name]_\
    NB - if you are overriding your website colors via CSS code, then you have to set your background colors via CSS code also and you will **not** see the Palette colors as shown in Figure 4.\
