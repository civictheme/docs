### Summary <a href="#servicecardcomponent-summary" id="servicecardcomponent-summary"></a>

The Service card lets you show one or more links. It consists of a title and links.

This article shows you how to add a Service card to a Manual list component.

Below you can see a Service card with 3 links. (We used 3 links in this example, but you can add any amount.)



### Step 1 - Add the Service card <a href="#servicecardcomponent-step1-addtheservicecard" id="servicecardcomponent-step1-addtheservicecard"></a>

Within your Manual list component under List items, click on the dropdown and select Service card as shown below.



### Step 2 - Fill in the various fields <a href="#servicecardcomponent-step2-fillinthevariousfields" id="servicecardcomponent-step2-fillinthevariousfields"></a>

The available fields are shown and numbered below.



1. Title - Add the title
2. Links/URL - You can add internal and external URLs. For internal URLs, this field autocompletes when you start typing the title of the internal content/page.
3. Links/Link text - Add the Link text. This is the hyperlink text that will be displayed to end users.
4. Add another item - Clicking on “Add another item” will dynamically add URL and Link text fields. You can add as many as you like.
5. Set the theme to light or dark.
