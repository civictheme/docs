### Summary <a href="#servicecardcomponent-summary" id="servicecardcomponent-summary"></a>

This article will guide you how to add a Service card sub-component to your Manual list component.

The Service card consists of one title, a customisable number of urls and link texts.

Figure 1 shows the final output of one Service card component with 3 links. (We used 3 links in this example, but you can add any amount).



### Step 1 - Add the Service card <a href="#servicecardcomponent-step1-addtheservicecard" id="servicecardcomponent-step1-addtheservicecard"></a>

Inside of your Manual list component under List items, click on the dropdown and select Service card as shown in Figure 2.



### Step 2 - Fill in the various fields <a href="#servicecardcomponent-step2-fillinthevariousfields" id="servicecardcomponent-step2-fillinthevariousfields"></a>

The available fields are shown and numbered in Figure 3.



1. Add the title
2. This is an autocomplete field. You can add internal and external URLs. For internal URLs, start by typing the title of the internal content.
3. Add the Link text. This is the hyperlink text that will be displayed to end users.
