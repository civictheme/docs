# Content

Out-of-the-box, CivicTheme comes with 3 content types:

* [Page](page-content-type/)
* [Event](event-content-type.md)
* [Alert](alert.md)

These are the most common content types that you need to start. You can add more content types as necessary.

### Page

The 'Page' content type is the most flexible content type.&#x20;

Choose from a wide range of CivicTheme out-of-the-box components to build pages.&#x20;

### Event

The 'Event' content type allows you to add event pages that display event details, date, location and map.

### Alert

You can add an 'Alert' to any page or section of your site. A horizontal Alert bar will display at the top of the webpage above the Header.&#x20;
