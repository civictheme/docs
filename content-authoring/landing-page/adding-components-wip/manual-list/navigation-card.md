This article will guide you how to add a Navigation card sub-component to your Manual list component.

The Navigation card consists of a title, image, summary text and a link.

Figure 1 shows four navigation cards (one per row) with different variations of field settings applied to each.



### Step 1 - Add the Navigation card <a href="#navigationcardcomponent-step1-addthenavigationcard" id="navigationcardcomponent-step1-addthenavigationcard"></a>

Inside of your Manual list component under List items, click on the dropdown and select Navigation card as shown in Figure 2.



### Step 2 - Fill in the various fields <a href="#navigationcardcomponent-step2-fillinthevariousfields" id="navigationcardcomponent-step2-fillinthevariousfields"></a>

The available fields are shown and numbered in Figure 3.



1. Title - set the card title
2. Image - upload an image (or select one from your media library)
3. Check this box to resize the image to an icon size (40x40)
4. Enter your custom text
5. The URL entered here will be the final destination if the end user clicks anywhere in the navigation card
6. Set the image size. The options are None, Small, Large
7. Set your theme preference

The output is shown in Figure 4.



NB - If you set the image to show as an Icon (point #3), then this will override the image size set at point #6.
