### About <a href="#aboutcivicthemedesignsystem-wip-about" id="aboutcivicthemedesignsystem-wip-about"></a>

CivicTheme is a true design system based on atomic design principles.

It’s made up of a set of standards, reusable components and patterns.

### What is Atomic Design? <a href="#aboutcivicthemedesignsystem-wip-whatisatomicdesign" id="aboutcivicthemedesignsystem-wip-whatisatomicdesign"></a>

Atomic design (as used in CivicTheme) is breaking common website components into finite set of elements such as:

* Atoms - these are the smallest building blocks on a site. They are usually the basic HTML elements such as Buttons, Links, Tables, Labels, Checkboxes and Text fields. Breaking these down any smaller with make them non-functional.
* Molecules - these can consist of simple grouping atoms together to form slightly bigger and common UI **reusable** components such as Accordions, Attachments, Call to Actions (CTAs or Callouts), Table of Contents.
* Organisms - These slightly more complex groupings of molecules that form even bigger and common components on a site. They mostly form distinct sections of the site. Examples are Alerts, Back to Top, Banner, Footer, Header, List, Navigation, Sliders.

Each of the these element plays a key role in the hierarchy of the interface design system.

To view more in-depth details of the different atomic design components used, head over to [CivicTheme Storybook](http://civictheme.io/storybook) which is a UI for exploring the aforementioned.
