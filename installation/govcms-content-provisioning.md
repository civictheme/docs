# Content Provisioning for CivicTheme

CivicTheme comes with pre-set Block Content blocks configuration. Since Drupal does not support running install hooks in themes, a custom content provisioning script has to be used.

## When to provision content

Content provisioning is needed in two scenarios:

1. **During initial setup** - When first installing CivicTheme
2. **After deployment** - When deploying to production environments

## Provisioning workflow

The provisioning needs to be run twice:

1. **Locally** - to capture created configuration for config entities (blocks, menus etc.)
2. **In production** - to populate the configuration with the default content

## Step-by-step instructions

### 1. Local provisioning

1. Login to the local instance of your site.

2. Navigate to `/admin/appearance/settings/<SUBTHEME_MACHINE_NAME>`

3. Press "Provision content" button.

4. Navigate to the homepage and observe that all blocks and menus are present.

5. Export config for created entities:
   ```sh
   ahoy drush cex -y
   ```

6. Commit and push to remote.

### 2. Production provisioning

1. Wait for deployment to finish and login to the Drupal instance.

2. Navigate to `/admin/appearance/settings/<SUBTHEME_MACHINE_NAME>`.

3. Press "Provision content" button.

4. Navigate to the homepage and observe that all blocks and menus are present.

## What gets provisioned

The content provisioning creates:

- **Block Content blocks** - Pre-configured content blocks for common page elements
- **Menu items** - Default menu structure
- **Configuration entities** - Required configuration for the theme to function properly

## Avoiding content forklift

If you want to avoid doing a full content migration (forklift) from local to production:

1. Use the `-n` flag when running the automated installation script
2. Provision content locally first
3. Export the configuration
4. Deploy configuration to production
5. Provision content in production

## Troubleshooting

### Content not appearing after provisioning

- Ensure caches are cleared: `ahoy drush cr`
- Check that the correct theme is set as default
- Verify that all required modules are enabled

### Provisioning button not available

- Ensure you're logged in as an administrator
- Check that the theme is properly installed and enabled
- Clear caches and try again

### Configuration export issues

- Make sure you have the correct permissions to export configuration
- Ensure that config imports are enabled (check with your GovCMS support ticket)
