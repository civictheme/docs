# GovCMS SaaS

CivicTheme can be installed on GovCMS SaaS using either an automated script or manual installation process.

## Installation Methods

### [Automated Installation (Recommended)](govcms-saas-manual.md)

The automated installation script is the preferred method for setting up CivicTheme on new GovCMS SaaS project. It handles most of the setup process automatically, including:

* Downloading and extracting CivicTheme
* Configuring required modules
* Creating your custom subtheme
* Optionally provisioning content blocks

For those who prefer more control over the installation process or cannot use the automated script, the manual installation guide provides step-by-step instructions for:

* Setting up your local environment
* Installing CivicTheme and dependencies
* Creating and configuring your subtheme
* Building and deploying assets
