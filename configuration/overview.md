Once the checkbox “Shortcut icon” is checked, then the Favicon options become available. You can upload your custom Favicon here.

### Colors <a href="#civicthemeconfiguration-colors" id="civicthemeconfiguration-colors"></a>

The expanded Colors settings are shown in Figure 5 below.



The most important setting is the “Use Color Selector” checkbox (highlighted in Figure 5).

If **checked**, then you can edit the colors by using the color palette. Additionally, you can also override some colors with CSS code although this is not recommended.

If **unchecked**, all colors will be overridden from your CSS code.

The Brand colors use predefined formulas that automatically update the palette colors. In other words, if you change the brand colors, then its corresponding dependents will automatically update. Click on “show dependants” to see the relationship.
