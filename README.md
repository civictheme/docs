# Introduction

### What is CivicTheme? <a href="#introduction-whatiscivictheme" id="introduction-whatiscivictheme"></a>

CivicTheme is an open source, inclusive and component-based design system. It was created so governments and corporations can rapidly assemble modern, consistent and compliant digital experiences.

### Intended Audience <a href="#introduction-intendedaudience" id="introduction-intendedaudience"></a>

This documentation is written with Site Editors, Content Administrators and Site Builders in mind.

### Prerequisites <a href="#introduction-prerequisites" id="introduction-prerequisites"></a>

You should be comfortable using tools such as WYSIWYG editors and adding/editing content via the web interface for any content management systems (such as Wordpress or Drupal).

As CivicTheme is currently built on the Drupal stack, having prior content administration experience with Drupal 7-9 or GovCMS is a bonus. Future builds of CivicTheme will support other popular decoupled UI frameworks such as React and Vue.

Prior HTML/CSS knowledge, development or coding experience is not required.
