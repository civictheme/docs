# Introduction

[CivicTheme](https://civictheme.io) is an open source, inclusive and component-based design system.

It was created so governments and corporations can rapidly assemble modern, consistent and compliant digital experiences.

It consists of 3 main assets:

1. Design theme
2. UI kit
3. Drupal theme

### Design system

CivicTheme is a true design system, based on [atomic design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) principles.

[Design System](https://civictheme.io/figma) is a Figma file that provides a visual representation of components and templates. It follows the same version as the UI Kit and Drupal theme.

#### What is atomic design? <a href="#aboutcivicthemedesignsystem-wip-whatisatomicdesign" id="aboutcivicthemedesignsystem-wip-whatisatomicdesign"></a>

Atomic design is breaking common website components into a finite set of elements such as:

* **Atoms** - these are the smallest building blocks on a site. They are usually the basic HTML elements such as Buttons, Links, Tables, Labels, Checkboxes and Text fields. Breaking these down any smaller will make them non-functional.
* **Molecules** - these can consist of a simple grouping of atoms to form slightly bigger and common UI **reusable** components such as Accordions, Attachments, Calls to Action (CTAs or Callouts), and Tables of Contents.
* **Organisms** - These are slightly more complex groupings of molecules that form even bigger (and common) components on a site. They mostly form distinct sections of the site. Examples are Alerts, Back to Top, Banner, Footer, Header, List, Navigation and Sliders.

Each of these elements plays a key role in the hierarchy of the interface design system.

### UI Kit <a href="#componentlibrary-wip-about" id="componentlibrary-wip-about"></a>

The [UI Kit ](https://civictheme.io/storybook)is a CMS-agnostic library of components built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The components have been built and assessed to comply with WCAG accessibility standards 2.1 AA out-of-the-box.

### Drupal theme

[Drupal theme](https://www.drupal.org/project/civictheme) is an implementation of the UI Kit for Drupal CMS.

The theme contains all necessary configurations and code to connect the CMS data with the components.
