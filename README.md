### Design system

CivicTheme is a true design system, based on [atomic design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) principles.

Design System is implemented as a [Figma file](https://civictheme.io/figma) that provides a visual representation of components and their usage within design templates.

### UI Kit <a href="#componentlibrary-wip-about" id="componentlibrary-wip-about"></a>

The [UI Kit](https://uikit.civictheme.io/) is a library of components built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The components have been built and assessed to comply with WCAG accessibility standards 2.2 AA out-of-the-box.

### Drupal theme

The Drupal theme contains all necessary configurations and code to connect the CMS data with the UI Kit components.
