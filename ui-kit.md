# UI kit

CivicTheme is a true design system based on atomic design principles.

[UI kit](https://civictheme.io/figma) provides a visual representation of components and templates. It follows the same versions as the Component Library and a Drupal theme.

### What is Atomic Design? <a href="#aboutcivicthemedesignsystem-wip-whatisatomicdesign" id="aboutcivicthemedesignsystem-wip-whatisatomicdesign"></a>

Atomic design is breaking common website components into finite set of elements such as:

* Atoms - these are the smallest building blocks on a site. They are usually the basic HTML elements such as Buttons, Links, Tables, Labels, Checkboxes and Text fields. Breaking these down any smaller will make them non-functional.
* Molecules - these can consist of simple grouping of atoms to form slightly bigger and common UI **reusable** components such as Accordions, Attachments, Calls to Action (CTAs or Callouts), Tables of Contents.
* Organisms - These are slightly more complex groupings of molecules that form even bigger (and common) components on a site. They mostly form distinct sections of the site. Examples are Alerts, Back to Top, Banner, Footer, Header, List, Navigation, Sliders.

Each of the these elements play a key role in the hierarchy of the interface design system.
