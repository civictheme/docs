  * [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
  * [Pygmy](https://github.com/pygmystack/pygmy)
  * [Ahoy](https://github.com/ahoy-cli/ahoy)
* Make sure that all local web development services are shut down (Apache/Nginx, Mysql, MAMP etc).
* Checkout project repository (in one of the [supported Docker directories](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs/#access-control)).
* `pygmy up`
* `ahoy build`
