# Component Library (wip)

### About <a href="#componentlibrary-wip-about" id="componentlibrary-wip-about"></a>

CivicTheme’s component library is the joining of code with design.

At the code layer we have Javascript, CSS and HTML and at the design layer we have Figma.

The design is a visual representation of what the code accomplishes. These “accomplishments” are broken into smaller functional pieces called components.

The CivicTheme component library has the following 3 key elements:

* User-centred design is imperative to the development process.
* Built and assessed to comply with WCAG accessibility standards 2.1 AA out-of-the-box.
* A neutral design system that’s not tied to a specific technology, framework, platform or system

### Viewing the Component Library <a href="#componentlibrary-wip-viewingthecomponentlibrary" id="componentlibrary-wip-viewingthecomponentlibrary"></a>

CivicTheme uses [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) which is a frontend UI to visualize the components. Having prior knowledge of Storybook is not a prerequisite.

[View the CivicTheme component library here](https://www.civictheme.io/storybook).

### Creating a new component <a href="#componentlibrary-wip-creatinganewcomponent" id="componentlibrary-wip-creatinganewcomponent"></a>

This can be done at the code level, but it will be out of scope for site administrators…

### Extending an existing component <a href="#componentlibrary-wip-extendinganexistingcomponent" id="componentlibrary-wip-extendinganexistingcomponent"></a>

This can be done at the code level, but it will be out of scope for site administrators…

### Contributing Back <a href="#componentlibrary-wip-contributingback" id="componentlibrary-wip-contributingback"></a>
