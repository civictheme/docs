# Code of conduct

### CivicTheme code of conduct

We ask that all members of our community, in any space (virtual or physical), adhere to this Code of Conduct, promoting understanding, empathy, and personal awareness of all individuals, including those from the Drupal and greater technical communities, even when disagreements arise.



***

### **Our pledge**

We pledge to create a welcoming, harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, experience level, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.



***

### **Our standards**

**Positive behaviours:**

* Use welcoming and inclusive language.
* Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
* Accept constructive criticism gracefully.
* Focus on what benefits the community.
* Show empathy towards others.

**Unacceptable behaviours:**

* Sexualised language or imagery, and unwelcome advances.
* Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments.
* Personal or political attacks.
* Harassment, public or private.
* Publishing others’ private information without permission.
* Conduct inappropriate in a professional setting.



***

### **Participation guidelines**

* **Listen and engage actively**: Read the conversation backlog before joining. Assume good intent, as participants come from diverse backgrounds.
* **Promote understanding and empathy**: Engage with others respectfully, especially those you may disagree with. Strive to increase personal awareness of diverse perspectives.
* **Respect other experiences**: Speak from your experience, not for others. Don’t invalidate someone’s story.
* **Challenge ideas, not people**: Ask questions and focus on the ideas being discussed without personal attacks.
* **Inclusive language**: Use stated names and pronouns, and respect others' identities. If unsure, ask respectfully in private.
* **Lurkers welcome**: Participation is valued, even if just observing. Introduce yourself when joining.



***

### **Handling off-topic discussions and sharing**

* **Stay on topic**: Avoid spamming, thread hijacking, or excessive off-topic conversation, especially during meetings.
* **Sharing content**: Do not share CivicTheme content without explicit permission from all participants involved.
* **Reporting issues**: Screenshots for harassment reporting are allowed without permission, but avoid using them to shame others.



***

### **Conflict and disruptive behaviour management**

* **Address conflicts directly**: Where safe, address issues in the space where they arise, or contact an admin for help.
* **Admin support**: Admins or Community Managers can help when conflicts escalate.
* **Tiered response system for disruptive behaviour**:
  * **Tier 1**: User is welcomed, asked to review participation guidelines, and read the backlog.
  * **Tier 2**: User is gently reminded to stay on topic or follow participation guidelines.
  * **Tier 3**: Moderator privately messages the user, explaining the issue and offering suggestions for improvement.
  * **Tier 4**: If behaviour persists, the user is kicked from Slack for at least 24 hours.
* **Non-tiered response (immediate ban)**: Intentionally disruptive users, engaging in bullying or harassment, may be kicked without following the tiered process. Repeated offenses will result in a permanent ban.
* **Re-admittance after kick**: Users kicked from Slack can message the moderator or another admin to request re-admittance. The kick is not a ban, and disruptive individuals can receive guidance on improving their behaviour and using more inclusive, sensitive language.

### **Our responsibilities**

Project maintainers are responsible for enforcing this code of conduct. They may remove, edit, or reject contributions or ban contributors for inappropriate behaviour.



***

### **Scope**

This code of conduct applies within project spaces and in public spaces where a community member represents CivicTheme (e.g., official emails or social media).



***

### **Enforcement**

Instances of unacceptable behaviour may be reported by contacting the team at [info@civictheme.io](mailto:info@civictheme.io). The team will review and investigate all complaints confidentially.



***

### **Attribution**

This code of conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4, Drupal Diversity & Inclusion’s Participation Guidelines, and CivicTheme community input.
