### Contribution criteria

The CivicTheme atomic design system is built on a set of UI building blocks. All of the CivicTheme components, patterns, icons and solutions are:

* Compliant with Australian Government design system&#x20;
* Built with WCAG 2.2 AA compliance in mind to meet accessibility standards
* &#x20;Adaptable with GovCMS Drupal 10 out-of-the box&#x20;
* Responsive&#x20;

Consider the criteria below before submitting your contribution for consideration: &#x20;

* **Purpose:** New designs should address specific needs, enhance user experience, and add value. They should either extend existing patterns or create new ones.&#x20;
* **User researched and tested:** Your contribution should be backed by user research and testing.
* **Accessibility tested:** Your design should meet WCAG 2.2 AA  accessibility standards or higher.
* **Atomic design:** Contributions should comply with atomic design principles to maintain consistency and modularity whilst aligning to existing design direction.

### How to contribute

Once you've established the type of contribution you wish to make, submit your design idea via GitHub to ensure transparency and community discussion.

1. **Create a** [**GitHub**](https://www.github.com) **account** (if you don’t have one).
2. **Go to the** [**CivicTheme UI Kit Project**](https://github.com/orgs/civictheme/projects/1/views/1) and check for existing issues related to your idea.
3. If your idea isn't listed, [**create a new issue**](https://github.com/civictheme/uikit/issues), using the relevant specification, and we’ll review it.

### Contribution formats

Ideally, design contributions should be supplied as fully realised Figma files and submitted via GitHub; however, we know this is not always possible, so there are other options.

With that in mind, the CivicTheme team will consider contributions in many formats:

* **Figma file**: A copy of the full CivicTheme Figma file, or a stand-alone file that we can merge into the main file.
* **Illustration file**: If you are adding illustrations or iconography to the UI kit, please provide an illustration file (.svg, .png, or .jpg).
* **Wireframe or sketches**: This can be a photo of that napkin you sketched your ideas on when inspiration hit.

### Working with Figma

If you’re working with a copy of the CivicTheme Figma file, once you’ve finished making changes, you need to export the file in <mark style="color:blue;">.fig</mark> format. To do this, go to "File" and select "Save as .fig." This will save the file on your local drive.

When saving the file, please use the prefix <mark style="color:blue;">CivicTheme\_Design\_</mark> then add your name to the end of the file name as shown below.

**Example**: CivicTheme\_Design\_\[<mark style="color:blue;">YourName</mark>].fig

### Submitting your design contributions

**Submitting via GitHub:**

1. **Select contribution type**:
   * If it’s a **small contribution**, such as minor tweaks or updates, select "Bug" or "Minor enhancement" as the issue type.
   * For **medium or major contributions**, select "Feature request."
2. **Title**:
   * Include "Design contribution" in the title, along with the specific focus of your contribution. For example:
     * _“Design contribution - Template - Homepage - Mobile”_ or,
     * _“Design contribution - Navigation component - Desktop”_
3. **User story**:
   * Fill out the "User Story" section in the issue template to describe the context and reasoning for your contribution. Be clear about the **problem** you're addressing and the **proposed solution**.
4. **Description**:
   * Provide a **detailed description** of your contribution. Include:
     * **Page and name**: Reference the page and component name from the Figma file where changes have been made. For example:&#x20;
       * _Page 05 Mobile Templates | Template - Homepage - Mobile_.
     * **Rationale**: Explain the reasoning behind your change. Why is it necessary? How does it improve CivicTheme's design system?
     * **Supporting evidence**: If your contribution is research-backed (e.g., user testing, accessibility standards), provide relevant links or documentation.
     * **Testing**: Indicate whether the change has been tested and provide results if applicable (e.g., design QA, browser/device testing).
5.  **Contribution type**:

    * For **small contributions**, provide a brief summary of changes.
    * For **medium contributions**, specify if the component can be reused or extended.
    * For **major contributions**, ensure the description aligns with the broader CivicTheme design principles and can be applied across multiple contexts.
