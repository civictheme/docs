# Organisms

**What are Organisms?** In CivicTheme, **organisms** are relatively complex components composed of groups of molecules and atoms working together as a cohesive unit, based on Brad Frost's **Atomic Design** principles. These larger, more sophisticated interface sections form distinct, recognizable portions of the interface.&#x20;

Organisms in CivicTheme include components such as headers, footers, navigation menus, and content listings, all designed to ensure **accessibility**, **consistency**, and **reusability** across digital services. These organisms are the functional building blocks of CivicTheme pages, combining multiple atoms and molecules to create meaningful interface sections while ensuring a consistent, accessible, and flexible design system across projects. Each organism follows **WCAG 2.2 AA standards** and is optimised for both design and development, with implementations available in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/nXTZFR1mKPLExtEbYtazzD/CivicTheme--Design-System-v1.9.0?node-id=0-1\&t=b83UZlIpwPkLMi9E-1) and **Storybook**.
