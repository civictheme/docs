### When to use

Use buttons to enable user interactions and initiate actions within your interface. Buttons are ideal for:

* Submitting forms
* Triggering modal dialogs
* Navigating between pages
* Applying changes or settings
* Initiating processes or transactions

### When not to use

Avoid using buttons in the following scenarios:

* For non-interactive text or labels (use regular text instead)
* As a replacement for links within body content (use inline links)
* To represent toggle states (use checkboxes or toggle switches)
* When an action is automatic and doesn't require user initiation

### Best practice guidelines

1. Use clear, action-oriented labels that describe what the button does
2. Ensure buttons are easily clickable/tappable, with appropriate sizing and spacing
3. Maintain consistent styling for button types across your interface
4. Use colour and prominence to indicate button hierarchy (primary, secondary, tertiary)
5. Provide visual feedback for all button states (hover, focus, active, disabled)
6. Ensure sufficient colour contrast between button text and background
7. Group related buttons together and align them consistently
8. Avoid using too many buttons in a single view to prevent overwhelming users

### Variations

### Accessibility

Based on the CivicTheme v1.7.0 Accessibility Assessment, the Button component has been evaluated against WCAG 2.2 guidelines. Here's a summary of its compliance:

Total tests: 12 Passed: 11 Failed: 1

| Total tests | Passed | Failed |
| ----------- | ------ | ------ |
| 11          | 10     | 1      |

Refer to the 'Buttons' accessibility compliance statement for a detailed WCAG 2.2 testing report.



The Button component passes most accessibility criteria, including contrast ratios, keyboard accessibility, focus visibility, and consistent identification. However, it fails on one criterion:

2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum) (Level AA): The size of the target for pointer inputs is not at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels.

This indicates that while the Button component is largely accessible, there is room for improvement in terms of its target size for better usability, especially for users with motor impairments.

### Existing usage of this component

The Button component is widely used across government, corporate, and educational websites built with CivicTheme. Some examples include:

1. Department of Industry, Science and Resources
2. Australian Digital Health Agency
3. Fair Work Ombudsman
4. University of Technology Sydney
5. City of Melbourne

\[Disclaimer: Component usage on these sites was accurate at the time of publication. Please verify the current implementation.]



### Component inspiration and uplift:&#x20;

The Button component was inspired by design work done in the Australian Government Design System (AGDS). CivicTheme has uplifted the element in the following ways:

1. Expanded size options: Added large and small variants to the standard size
2. Enhanced iconography: Included options for left/right icons and download indicators
3. Improved states: Refined hover, focus, and disabled states for better visual feedback
4. Accessibility enhancements: Improved colour contrast and focus indicators

### Research on this component

#### UX Score: ★★★★☆ (4 out of 5 stars)

#### Confidence rating: High

The Button component has been extensively researched and tested across multiple CivicTheme projects and other government design systems. Key research findings include:

1. Usability testing: Conducted 5 rounds of user testing with a total of 50 participants across various government agencies. Tests focused on button recognition, interaction, and effectiveness in completing tasks.
2. A/B testing: Performed on button placement, colour, and label text across 3 high-traffic government websites, involving over 10,000 users.
3. Accessibility audits: Comprehensive audits conducted by external accessibility experts, ensuring WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
4. Comparative analysis: Examined button implementations across 10 leading government and corporate design systems to identify best practices and areas for improvement.

#### Key insights:

* Users consistently recognize and understand the purpose of buttons across different visual styles
* Clear, action-oriented labels significantly improve task completion rates
* Proper visual hierarchy (primary vs secondary buttons) helps users prioritize actions
* Consistent button styling across an interface increases user confidence and reduces cognitive load

#### Known issues:

1. On some mobile devices, the touch target area for small buttons may be slightly below the recommended size guidelines. This is being addressed in an upcoming release.

#### More research needed:

1. Long-term impact of button colour schemes on user trust and brand perception
2. Effectiveness of animated button states in improving user engagement
3. Cultural differences in button label preferences and understanding
