# Molecules

**What are Molecules?** In CivicTheme, **molecules** are combinations of atoms that work together as a functional unit, based on Brad Frost's **Atomic Design** principles. These components are created by joining multiple atoms to form simple, reusable interface elements with distinct functionality.&#x20;

Molecules in CivicTheme include components such as search fields, navigation items, and card components, all designed to ensure **accessibility**, **consistency**, and **reusability** across digital services. These molecules serve as the connective tissue of CivicTheme, bridging atoms and more complex organisms, ensuring a consistent, accessible, and flexible design system across projects. Each molecule follows **WCAG 2.2 AA standards** and is optimised for both design and development, with implementations available in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/nXTZFR1mKPLExtEbYtazzD/CivicTheme--Design-System-v1.9.0?node-id=0-1\&t=b83UZlIpwPkLMi9E-1) and **Storybook**.
