Development of the entire CivicTheme ecosystem is managed in the GitHub `civictheme` organization: [https://github.com/civictheme/](https://github.com/civictheme/).\
This allows to develop the Drupal theme and modules at the same place and use advanced CI configuration for testing.\
The code from the monorepo is automatically published to Drupal.org with all commit and author information preserved.
