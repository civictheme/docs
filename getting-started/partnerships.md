# Partnerships

### CivicTheme partnerships and collaboration

CivicTheme is an **open-source design system** governed by a diverse community of **government agencies**, **digital agencies**, and **individual contributors**. The **open-governance model** ensures that CivicTheme grows in a way that benefits the wider community while maintaining consistency, accessibility, and government-grade standards.



***

### **Partnering with CivicTheme**

If you would like to collaborate on CivicTheme, particularly for large contributions like developing a version for another technology (e.g., React, Vue, etc.), the following guidelines will help ensure a smooth process and productive partnership:

#### **1. Proposal submission**

Before any major development begins, it’s important to present your idea to the broader CivicTheme community for consideration. This will ensure that the proposed work aligns with the current vision and standards of CivicTheme. To initiate a partnership:

* **Submit a proposal**: Provide an outline of your partnership idea via **GitHub** (e.g., in the form of an RFC or issue) or directly reach out to the CivicTheme team at [info@civictheme.io](mailto:info@civictheme.io).
* Include details such as:
  * **Goal**: What is the purpose of your proposal (e.g., creating a **React** version of CivicTheme)?
  * **Scope**: What components or parts of the system would this impact?
  * **Resources**: How will your team contribute (e.g., developers, designers, testers)?
  * **Timeline**: Provide a rough estimate of timeframes for the proposed work.

#### **2. Community and governance review**

Once the proposal is submitted, it will be reviewed by the **CivicTheme governing body**, which includes key stakeholders from government agencies, digital agencies, and the broader CivicTheme community.

The review process includes:

* **Discussion and feedback**: Your proposal will be discussed in community meetings and may receive feedback or suggestions for modification.
* **Community involvement**: Depending on the scope of the proposal, input from the broader community may be solicited to ensure the change aligns with CivicTheme's goals.

#### **3. Partnership meeting**

For large-scale contributions like developing a **React version** of CivicTheme, it will be necessary to hold a **partnership meeting** with the CivicTheme core team and stakeholders. This meeting will allow for deeper discussion on:

* **Technical approach**: How will the new version (e.g., React) be structured, and what are the technical requirements?
* **Alignment with CivicTheme principles**: Ensuring that the new version adheres to the same **accessibility**, **design standards**, and **component structure** as the original.
* **Governance and maintenance**: Defining responsibilities for ongoing maintenance and updates, and ensuring the new version has long-term support.
* **Community benefits**: Evaluating how the new version will support the wider CivicTheme community and government users.

The **CivicTheme governing body** will provide feedback and give approval before moving forward.

#### **4. Development and implementation**

Once the partnership has been approved, development can proceed with continued community involvement:

* **Open development**: Keep the development of the new version open and transparent, using GitHub for version control, issues, and pull requests.
* **Regular updates**: Provide regular progress updates to the CivicTheme community, either through GitHub, Slack, or dedicated community meetings.
* **Collaboration**: CivicTheme is built on collaboration, so invite input and feedback from other developers and contributors during the development process.

#### **5. Testing and quality assurance**

CivicTheme adheres to **government-grade standards** for **accessibility**, **security**, and **performance**. Any new partnership should ensure that:

* The new version (e.g., React) follows the **WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility guidelines**.
* It is tested for **cross-browser** and **cross-device compatibility**.
* The new components match the design and behaviour of existing CivicTheme components.

Community testing and feedback will be encouraged to maintain the highest standards of quality.
