# Layout builder

CivicTheme provides two base layouts:

* Edge-to-edge layout
* Contained layout

`Edge-to-edge` layout provides a landing page style where the backgrounds of the components extend the full width of the browser window. If there is a sidebar the content becomes constrained automatically.

`Contained` layout provides a constraint on container width and is used in more traditional style pages.

These layouts can be built upon and are defined in the `civictheme.info.yml` .

The layout look and feel is a [component from the UI kit](https://www.civictheme.io/themes/custom/civicthemeio/storybook-static/index.html?path=/story/base-layout--layout).
